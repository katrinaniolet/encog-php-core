 * This interface allows various activation functions to be used with the neural
 * network. Activation functions are applied to the output from each layer of a
 * neural network. Activation functions scale the output into the desired range.
 *
 * Methods are provided both to process the activation function, as well as the
 * derivative of the function. Some training algorithms, particularly back
 * propagation, require that it be possible to take the derivative of the
 * activation function.
 *
 * Not all activation functions support derivatives. If you implement an
 * activation function that is not derivable then an exception should be thrown
 * inside of the derivativeFunction method implementation.
 *
 * Non-derivable activation functions are perfectly valid, they simply cannot be
 * used with every training algorithm.

 * This interface is the base for all Encog Machine Learning methods.  It
 * defines very little, other than the fact that a subclass is a Machine
 * Learning Method.  A MLMethod is an algorithm that accepts data and
 * provides some sort of insight into it.  This could be a neural network,
 * support vector machine, clustering algorithm, or something else entirely.
 *
 * Many MLMethods must be trained by a MLTrain object before they are useful.
